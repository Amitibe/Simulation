# Stimulation
A basic stimulation about some circles and their life cycle.


This stimulation represents life in a spcific environment.
These are the rules of nature in this environment:
1) Every "day" a new constent number of food items are created. 
2) If a creature doesn't eat food during that "day" it dies.
3) If a creature eats only one food item it survives.
4) If a creature eats two or more food items it repreduces.
5) The new born creature is mutated and gets a random radius in relation to its parent(50% to 150% its size).
6) A creatures speed is determined by its radius(20/radius).
7) A creatures color is determined by its speed.
8) After a number of days the stimulation is finished.

The purpuse of the stimulation is to see which gene is better to have in this enviroment, being big or being fast.
There is an addition of Hunters which have the same rules only they have to eat creatures.
